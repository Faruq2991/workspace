This Python code reads a file named "story.txt" and extracts words enclosed within angle brackets < and >. Here's a breakdown of what it does:
Opens the file "story.txt" in read mode.
Reads the content of the file into the variable story.
Initializes an empty set words to store the extracted words.
Initializes start_of_word variable to keep track of the start position of a word initially set to -1.
Defines target_start and target_end variables to represent the start and end characters of the word respectively.
Loops through each character in the story string using enumerate() to also get the index.
If the current character is <, it updates start_of_word to the current index, indicating the start of a word.
If the current character is > and start_of_word is not -1 (indicating the start of a word was found earlier), it extracts the word from story based on the start and end positions and appends it to the words set. It then resets start_of_word to -1 to mark the end of the current word.
After the loop completes, it prints the set of extracted words.
This script will find words enclosed within angle brackets in the text file and store them in the words set.
